# Homework 3: Performance of vertex data locality

Made by Drew Smith.

I wanted to refactor some of the code to be accessible through a large shared library... This is a start, sure, but I didn't know what I was doing so I ended up abstracting a lof of it into function calls without much control over the API. A current goal is to get each major vulkan object a larger class to handle common procedures and be able to interact with other objects, but still maintain control over the actual API.

Key bindings:

- p/P : Toggle between orthogonal & perspective projection
- m/M : Stop/start light movement
- -/+ : Move light up/down
- [/] : Move light in orbit
- arrows : Change view angle
- ESC : Exit
