# Homework 5: WebGL

Made by Drew Smith.

The goal of this program is to allow the WebGL canvas to display objects in front of or behind elements in the page.
Although the WebGL canvas is not able to perform this independantly of the browser content (It would create security
risks to be able to load in the webpage content as a texture), telling the WebGL instance to search the DOM for certain
style families that have z-info about each element could be a viable method of controlling this.

Time to complete: ~10 hours
