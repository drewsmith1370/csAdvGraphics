# Homework 7: Textures

CSCI 4239
Made by Drew Smith. This is a very simple grid-based solver from a paper by Jos Stam.

It uses a combination of explicit and implicit techniques with performance and stability as a priority.

I ran out of time to make it even more interactive, but feel free to change the values in the compute shader to see their affect on the simulation.
Due to the implicit nature, it should (Hopefully!) not blow up. If it does, it's probably trying to pull advection from behind a wall or something.

Key bindings:

- Mouse: Click and drag to add a source of density. It will also add velocity that follows your mouse.
- Space : Toggle source at left wall
- 0 : Reset fluid texture
- ESC : Exit

Time to complete: ~12 hours? It was really fun so I lost track
