# Homework 1: NDC to RGB Shader

Made by Drew Smith. This is a very simple one-liner shader, using code from ex01 as a starting point.

Key bindings:

- m : Toggle shader
- o : Change objects
- arrows : Look around
- =, - : Zoom in, out
- 0 : Reset view angle
- ESC : Exit

Time to complete: Literally a few minutes for the shader program. I spent a couple hours playing around with the library and changing some features.
