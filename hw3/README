# Homework 2: Procedurally Generated Water Normal Shader

Made by Drew Smith. This Shader uses texture coordinates to generate a normal map with sinusoids, then orients them to the world using the TNB vectors at each vertex. The second shader shows a normal mapping demo with a ripple effect. Third shader is basic lighting using TNB normal.

Key bindings:

- Space : Pause/Unpause
- L : Toggle light rotation
- m : Toggle shader
- o : Change objects
- arrows : Look around
- =, - : Zoom in, out
- 0 : Reset view angle
- ESC : Exit

Time to complete: 7-8 hours; the holiday helped a lot.
