# Homework 3: Performance of vertex data locality

Made by Drew Smith. The goal of this program is to compare the performance of using local vs nonlocal vertex data.

This program has two types of rudimentary VAO object loader alongside Vlakkies display list loader:

- The first creates a VAO where the normals are local to each vertex
- The second creates a VAO where the normals are all placed after the vertices

Key bindings:

- Space : Pause/Unpause
- m : Toggle loader mode
- o : Change objects
- arrows : Look around
- =, - : Zoom in, out
- 0 : Reset view angle
- ESC : Exit

## Estimated Findings

School laptop with Intel Core i3 / Integrated graphics:

- 1000 FPS for Localized VAO T-Rex
- 600 FPS for Nonlocalized VAO T-Rex
- 70 FPS for Display list T-Rex
- 5000 FPS for basic cube

Time to complete: 7-8 hours; the holiday helped a lot.
