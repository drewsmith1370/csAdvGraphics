# Homework 3: Performance of vertex data locality

Made by Drew Smith. The goal of this program is to compare the performance of using local vs nonlocal vertex data.

This program has two types of rudimentary VAO object loader alongside Vlakkies display list loader:

- The first creates a VAO where the normals are local to each vertex
- The second creates a VAO where the normals are all placed after the vertices

Key bindings:

- Space : Pause/Unpause
- m : Toggle loader mode
- o : Change objects
- arrows : Look around
- =, - : Zoom in, out
- 0 : Reset view angle
- ESC : Exit

## Findings

School laptop with Intel Core i3 / Integrated graphics:

- 1000 FPS for Localized VAO T-Rex
- 600 FPS for Nonlocalized VAO T-Rex
- 70 FPS for Display list T-Rex
- 5000 FPS for basic cube

PC with AMD 7800X GPU:

- 5600 FPS for Localized VAO T-Rex
- 5500 FPS for Nonlocalized VAO T-Rex
- 300 FPS for Display list T-Rex
- 23000 FPS for basic cube

Notably, the AMD drivers for display lists didn't seem to work, and kept making the program seg fault before the framerate settled.
Also, the object loader is much faster on the intel system, probably because of how I did the buffer writes and the close proximity of the integrated graphics.

Time to complete: ~10 hours, mainly debugging the dang object loader.
