# Week 1: NDC to RGB

I think I met the goals. I didn't realize the potential for using default
shaders from OpenGL, but I got my shaders down to one line each. I feel like I
learned from this.

# Homework 2 goals:

For this homework (procedurally generated textures), I want to implement
normal mapping. I think making a working normal map system to display waves
and ripples will be sufficient, and as a stretch goal, I will add a skybox and
basic reflections to the texture.
