# Homework 2 review

I successfully implemented two different normal mapped textures, which I am
happy about. I did not achieve my stretch goal, but the normal mapping was
more involved than I had anticipated, since I had to implement TNBs for each
vertex and ended up drawing the cube instead in a VAO to pass these as vertex
attributes. I remade lighting to use the TNB matrix and then implemented the
mapped normals by thinking of the texture as a surface z=f(x,y) which can be
re-expressed as z-f(x,y)=constant. Then the gradient of this function becomes
(-df/dx, -df/dy, 1) which can be rotated with the TNB matrix to produce the
intended result.

# Homework 3 goals (Performance)

My goal for homework 3 is to explore the performance of different rendering
techniques. Specifically, I want to create an object loader that uses a VAO
and contend it with Vlakkies' DisplayList object loader. I would also like to
see how the loader compares when GLSL 400 compatibility vs 400 core vs 120
compares.
