# Homework 5 review

I am quite proud of my little program; while it isn't much to look at, the solutions I found were pretty elegant
and I think they will scale up nicely. This could also be a fun final project if I decide it to be. However, while
it was a fun experiment, I don't know how much I could learn from a final project like that. Overall, I think I
earned an A- for that homework.


# Homework 6 goals (Image Processing)

I really don't have much time this week, and Thursday is my birthday, so I think I will go somewhat light
compared to what I have been doing and only go for a B. I want to implement screen-space ambient occlusion into a
scene. Additionally, if I have time, I will look into color correction and potentially bloom and blur features.
