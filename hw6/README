# Homework 6: Image Processing

CSCI 4239
Made by Drew Smith. The goal of this program is to explore pure-depth screenspace ambient occlusion (SSAO)
as a postprocessing technique. The technique technically only needs depth data to operate on, which is how it is
implemented here, but benefits from a texture containing normals as well. The result is quite noisy due to the
random nature of the algorithm, but could be improved through a low-pass filter (shown with the blur filter from
Vlakkies, but better would be to do this separately from image data or follow-up with sharpening).

Key bindings:

- Space : Pause/Unpause
- arrows : Look around
- m : Toggle filter mode
- l: Toggle lighting off/on
- b: Toggle blur on/off
- =, - : Zoom in, out
- 0 : Reset view angle
- ESC : Exit

Time to complete: ~8 hours.
